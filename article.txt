In this document, I collect the papers I found interesting  to read for the research.

1) projection-based reduced order model for simulations of Nonlinear flows with multiple moving objects: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02338.pdf
Openfoam is used in this paper combining with POD.

2) Global model reduction for flows with moving boundary: https://wordpress.nmsu.edu/mjwei/files/2015/05/AIAA-2014-0222_Wei.pdf.

In this paper, the computational domain is a fixed domain and the method used is the immersed boundary method(IB). We can use moving domain and ALE method.

3) Finite Volume Based Fluid-Structure Interaction Solver: 

4) OpenFOAM FINITE VOLUME SOLVER FOR FLUID-SOLID INTERACTION
